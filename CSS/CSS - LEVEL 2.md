# CSS Display Property

- Controls how an element is displayed and how it participates in the layout.
- Common values:
    - `block`: Element starts on a new line and takes full width (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`).    
    - `inline`: Element flows with text and only takes as much width as needed (e.g., `<span>`, `<a>`).
    - `inline-block`: Like inline but can have width and height.
